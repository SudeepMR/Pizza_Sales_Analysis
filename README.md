# Pizza_Sales_Analysis

Pizza Sales Dashboard using Power BI


As part of the maven analytics challenge, I have performed data analysis and designed a dashboard in Power BI

Live Dashboard [Link](https://www.novypro.com/project/a-years-worth-of-sales-from-a-fictitious-pizza-place)


# Pizza Place Sales

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

# Recommended Analysis

+ How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
+ How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
+ How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
+ Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
