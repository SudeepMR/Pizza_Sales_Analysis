# Pizza_Sales_Analysis

Pizza Sales Dashboard using Power BI


As part of the maven analytics challenge, I have performed data analysis and designed a dashboard in Power BI

Live Dashboard [Link](https://www.novypro.com/project/a-years-worth-of-sales-from-a-fictitious-pizza-place)


# Pizza Place Sales

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

# Recommended Analysis

+ How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
+ How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
+ How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
+ Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

# Some Important insights from the Dashboard

+ The average number of customers per day is 60, and 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. is the peak hour of sale.
+ There is an average of 2 pizzas in an order, and the best-selling pizza is the Thai Chicken Pizza.
+ The total profit made this year is $817.86K, and people are more interested in Thai chicken and spicy Italian pizzas.
+ We should remove Brie Carre Pizza and Green Garden Pizza from the menu since they are the least popular pizzas.
